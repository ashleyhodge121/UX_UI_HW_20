          People want to donate items where they are needed most, however, they tend to donate mostly to organizations
          they are already familiar with, which lessens the impact on other charitable organizations in their community.

          <p class="lead3">The Solution</p>
          Bridge resolves the struggles of people wanting an easy way to access information about the charitable needs
          in their local community. The app equips them with tools that streamline their research experience and also
          provides them with resources to create positive change.

    <h2>Definition & Ideation</h2>
    <p class="lead">User Insight Statement</p>
    During the interviews and survey, we discovered that many people donate to other people or organizations in
    need if they knew about them and would also love to feel they are truly making a difference when donating.
    Therefore, we believe that donors need an easier way to find people and organizations that are in need and that
    we might be able to help if we create an app that not only allows you to know all about organizations in one’s
    area but also about people nearby that may need assistance.

    We might do this by allowing users to search for organizations in one’s area and provide their most important
    information such as hours of operation and goods that they accept while also having a section in the app
    where people can post what they are in need of and what area they reside in so users are aware of more recipients
    to donate to. Doing this will allow our product to give users more options when donating and allow them to feel
    like they are truly making an impact by donating their goods to those really in need.
    <p class="lead">Value Proposition</p>
    Our organization Bridge is developing a Mobile Donation App to help people giving or seeking
    donations find an easy way to connect to non-profits, groups or individuals within their
    communities which in turn elevates local support.
    We’re better because we offer a community driven centralized locator which enables those giving
    and those needing a direct way to communicate and connect.
    We’re believable because we have
    streamlined and personalized the process of local charitable giving which speaks directly to the
    heart of effecting positive change.
